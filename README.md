# Leap-Year-Checker
A simple Java console application that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. This project is part of my Java practice assignments (DIY #9) and demonstrates the use of conditional statements and logical operators in real-world problem solving.

ðŸ“– What is a Leap Year?

A leap year is a year that has 366 days instead of 365, with an extra day added to February (29 days instead of 28). Leap years keep our calendar aligned with the Earthâ€™s orbit around the Sun.

âœ… Leap Year Rules:

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.

If the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.

However, if the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

This ensures that leap years happen roughly every 4 years, but not every century, except every 400 years.

ðŸ”‘ Features

Takes a year as input from the user.

Uses if-else conditions to apply leap year rules.

Handles different cases like regular years, century years, and special 400-year cases.

Prints clear output messages:

"2000 is a leap year."

"1900 is not a leap year."
